## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone or Download** the project files
2. **Open** `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. **Start Creating** - Upload assets and begin animating!

### Browser Requirements
- Modern browser with Canvas API support
- MediaRecorder API for video export (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- File API for asset uploads
- LocalStorage for project saving

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Creating Your First Animation

1. **Upload Assets**
   - Click "Upload Assets" or drag images onto the canvas
   - Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG

2. **Add Objects to Canvas**
   - Drag assets from the asset panel to the canvas
   - Double-click assets to add them to the center
   - Use the toolbar to select different tools

3. **Set Keyframes**
   - Move the timeline playhead to a specific time
   - Adjust object properties (position, rotation, scale)
   - Click "Add Keyframe" to save the state

4. **Create Animation**
   - Move to a different time on the timeline
   - Change object properties to create movement
   - The engine automatically interpolates between keyframes

5. **Preview & Export**
   - Use playback controls to preview your animation
   - Export as WebM video or prepare GIF data
   - Save projects for later editing

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Spacebar** - Play/Pause animation
- **Ctrl+S** - Save project
- **Ctrl+O** - Load project
- **Ctrl+N** - New project
- **Ctrl+E** - Export video
- **Delete** - Delete selected objects
- **Escape** - Clear selection
- **Ctrl+D** - Duplicate selected objects

### Timeline Controls

- **Play/Pause** - Control animation playback
- **Stop** - Stop and reset to beginning
- **Rewind** - Jump to start
- **Duration** - Set total animation length
- **FPS** - Set frames per second

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Export Formats

The export system is modular and can be extended:

```javascript
// Add to project-exporter.js
async exportToMP4(options = {}) {
    // Implementation for MP4 export
    // Would require additional video encoding library
}
```

### Custom Easing Functions

Add new interpolation types to the timeline:

```javascript
// In timeline.js
this.interpolationTypes = {
    // ... existing types
    BOUNCE: 'bounce',
    ELASTIC: 'elastic'
};
```

### New Object Types

Extend the canvas engine with new drawable objects:

```javascript
// In canvas-engine.js
addCustomObject(type, properties) {
    return this.createObject(type, {
        // Custom object properties
        ...properties
    });
}
```

## 🎨 Advanced Features

### Multi-track Animation
- Each object gets its own timeline track
- Independent property animation per object
- Keyframe interpolation with custom easing

### Asset Organization
- Category-based organization
- Tag system for flexible grouping
- Search functionality with keyword indexing

### Project Management
- Auto-save functionality
- Project templates
- Version control ready (JSON-based projects)

### Performance Optimization
- Object-level dirty checking
- Canvas rendering optimization
- Asset caching and preloading

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a complete, self-contained animation tool. Potential areas for enhancement:

- **Audio Integration** - Full Web Audio API implementation
- **Advanced Timeline** - More sophisticated timeline UI
- **Plugin System** - Extensible architecture for third-party plugins
- **Cloud Storage** - Integration with cloud storage providers
- **Real-time Collaboration** - Multi-user editing capabilities

## 📄 License

Open source project. Feel free to use, modify, and distribute.

## 🎯 Roadmap

- [ ] Advanced timeline UI with visual keyframes
- [ ] Audio waveform visualization and sync
- [ ] Path-based animation tools
- [ ] Text animation presets
- [ ] Shape drawing tools
- [ ] Layer effects and filters
- [ ] Real-time collaboration
- [ ] Mobile responsive interface
- [ ] Plugin architecture
- [ ] Cloud project storage

## 🐛 Known Issues

- GIF export requires additional library (gif.js or similar)
- Audio sync implementation is basic
- Timeline UI is simplified (full implementation planned)
- Mobile touch support needs enhancement

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

1. **Performance** - Limit canvas size and object count for smooth playback
2. **Assets** - Use optimized images for better performance
3. **Keyframes** - Set keyframes at key moments, let interpolation handle the rest
4. **Export** - WebM provides the best quality-to-size ratio
5. **Organization** - Use the asset categorization system for large projects
